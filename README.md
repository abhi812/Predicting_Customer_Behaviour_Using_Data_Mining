# Predicting_Customer_Behaviour_Using_Data_Mining

This work focusses on Association rule mining techniques for identifying customer behavior. This will further help in building appropriate recommendations of different products to the customer (Basically, thing like, “These are the things which are usually bought together”, “If you liked this, you might like this” etc.)

Data Description:

•	The data consists of more than 88,000 rows of observations. These rows reflect the number of transactions that have happened from a varied number of products with ID varying from 1 to 16400.

•	Each row represents the products ID in one transaction that have been bought together

Idea:

•	Using the history of data transactions, association rules are to be identified to determine which products are usually bought together or if one product is bought, what other products are most like to be bought along with it.

Methodology:

•	Association rule mining techniques has been used for this purpose.

•	Apriori algorithm and simple randomized algorithm has been implemented using Python in the Jupyter notebook for frequent itemset generation.

•	Finally, association rules have been generated to identify the customer purchase behavior for different product ID’s.
